Build a Todo list as a mini front-end application. You don't have to use a database, the front-end is more important - you can use an appropriate data structure stored somewhere in your JavaScript (this time only!)

Here are the core user stories:

```
As a forgetful person
I want to store my tasks
So that I don't forget them

As a person with limited time
I want to instantly be able to update my todo list (adding and changing entries)
So that I have more time to think about other things

As a person who actually gets stuff done
I want to mark my tasks as done
So that I don't do them twice
```

Here are some other user stories you may choose to implement:

```
As a person with a lot of tasks
I want to be able to filter my tasks by "All", "Active", "Complete"
So that I only see the relevant tasks

As a person who doesn't like counting by hand
I want to see a total number of tasks
So that I don't have to count

As someone who has done lots of stuff
I want to be able to clear my completed tasks
So I never see them again
```

As you may imagine, implementing a To-do list is very much a solved problem. However, we are mainly interested in seeing how you approach testing and design. We are looking for:

* well written, well structured acceptance and unit tests
* clear and expressive JavaScript
* good HTML5 markup

Don't worry about deployment, and make sure you read the CONTRIBUTING.md when submitting a pull request.

## Extensions

* Deploy the app
* Create a persistance layer (e.g. MongoDB), or use LocalStorage or the filesystem through Node
* Make it look purdy (CSS) - try a framework like Bootstrap or Foundation

## CI

Read the `.travis.yml` if any of the steps below don't make sense! 

* Make sure you have set up `npm test` in your `package.json` so that it runs your Karma tests
* Make sure you have your Protractor config file at `e2e/conf.js`
* Make sure `npm start` spins up whatever serves up your app - `http-server`, Sinatra or Node

Good luck!
