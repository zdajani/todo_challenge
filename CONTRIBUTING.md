# Friday Challenge Submission Guidelines

Before submitting, please review the requirements/guidelines below.

*  Try to set up [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org) on your own repo and add a [status badge](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/status-images/) to your README showing that all tests are passing - make sure it passes our own CI when you submit your PR. 
* Make sure you have written your own README that briefly explains your approach to solving the challenge.
* If your code isn't finished, explain in your README how far you got and how you would plan to finish the challenge.
* All code **must** be written test-first - we're looking for 100% test coverage or as near as possible to that figure.
* Ensure you've understood the specification and built the code according to the challenge guidelines.
* Read through [Code Reviews](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/blob/master/pills/code_reviews.md):pill: to understand what we're looking for in your code.
